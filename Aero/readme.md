# Data Science Portfolio Project

Welcome to my data science portfolio project! This project aims to showcase my skills in data scraping, cleaning, and analysis. The project is divided into three main sections: data scraping, data cleaning, and machine learning.
# Data Scraping

I have implemented two methods of data scraping in this project: scraping PDFs and scraping the FAA website. The code for scraping PDFs can be found in the import_pdf.py file. This code uses the PyPDF2 library to extract text from a PDF and then uses regex to extract the relevant information.

The code for scraping the FAA website can be found in the scrape_nnumber_faa.py file. This code uses the selenium library to scrape aircraft registration data from the FAA website.
# Data Cleaning

Once I had collected the data, I needed to clean it to make it usable for analysis. This involved removing irrelevant data, filling in missing values, and formatting the data so that it could be used with machine learning algorithms. 

# Dash Dashboard

To showcase the insights and results from the data, I have built a Dash dashboard to visualize the data. The code for the dashboard can be found in the dashboard.py file. The dashboard allows for easy exploration of the data and is designed to be user-friendly.

# Machine Learning

With the cleaned data, I used machine learning algorithms to analyze the data. I used both K-means and Random Forest algorithm in the machine_learning.py file. The K-means algorithm was used to cluster the data into groups based on similar characteristics, and the Random Forest algorithm was used to predict the outcome.


# Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to scrape and clean data, data visualization, as well as my proficiency in machine learning techniques. I hope you find it informative and enjoyable!

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments about the project. I would be happy to discuss it further with you.
