    "# Predicting Aircraft Registration Types using a Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "In this data science portfolio project, you will see the various tasks I have completed utilizing web scraping, data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, I built a web scraper using the PyPDF2 and pandas libraries to scrape a pdf of registered aircraft from the FAA. I then used the scraped data to get a list of N-nbr, which I used to scrape the FAA registry for all relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I performed various preprocessing steps on the scraped data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. I also did feature engineering by adding new features such as the age of the aircraft and time since the certificate was issued.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the visualization library Plotly Dash to build a dashboard that allows for the interactive exploration of the data. The dashboard includes different types of visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, pie charts and stacked bar charts and allows users to filter the data by manufacturer name and engine type.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also used unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering, to group the aircraft into different clusters based on their expiration date, aircraft information and registration type."

    "The scrape_pdf function is a powerful tool for extracting data from PDF documents. It utilizes the PyPDF2 library to open and read the contents of a PDF file, then uses a combination of string manipulation techniques such as regular expressions and splitting to extract the desired data. The extracted data is then stored in a list, which is subsequently converted into a pandas DataFrame for further processing. One key feature of this function is its ability to handle PDF files with varying formatting, as it accounts for different ways in which data may be presented in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function can be used to extract a wide variety of information from PDFs. In this specific case, the function is being used to scrape data on registered aircraft from the FAA. This data includes information such as the registrant's name, aircraft N-number, mailing address, manufacturer, and more. This information is crucial for understanding the fleet of aircrafts in the country, and can be used for various analysis such as predicting aircrafts that may need maintenance soon, or identifying the most popular manufacturers in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "For server and time related reasons only registrant companies with more than 5 aircrafts will be considered."

The function then extracts data from the corresponding aircraft registration page and stores it in a DataFrame. This function demonstrates the ability to use web scraping techniques to gather data from dynamic websites and the ability to work with data in a programmatic way using the Pandas library. Additionally, by using a loop to iterate through the unique N-numbers in the original dataframe, this function also showcases the ability to scale the scraping process to handle a large number of inputs efficiently. The final DataFrame can then be used for further data analysis and visualization."

    "Next, the code splits the data into training and test sets, using the train_test_split function from sklearn. The RandomizedSearchCV function is then used to perform a randomized search over a defined range of hyperparameters for the Random Forest classifier. The model is then fit to the training data and used to make predictions on the test set.\n",

These metrics provide insight into how well the model is able to accurately predict the type of registration for an aircraft based on the input features. Overall, this code demonstrates a variety of data science skills including data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection and tuning, and model evaluation."

    "In conclusion, this data science project demonstrates a wide range of skills and techniques that are commonly used in the field. The project begins by scraping data from a PDF document using the PyPDF2 library and regular expressions. The scraped data is then used to scrape additional information from the FAA registry using the Selenium webdriver. This data is then cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed to prepare it for analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project then moves on to data visualization using the Plotly Dash library. The dashboard allows the user to explore various aspects of the data such as aircraft manufacturer, engine type, and certification expiration dates. Additionally, the dashboard includes interactive scatter plots and maps which allow for further exploration of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques for classification. A Random Forest classifier is trained on the data and its performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results show that the model has an accuracy of 0.70, precision of 0.69, recall of 0.70, and an F1-score of 0.69. While these scores are not perfect, they are still considered to be good results and the model can be used as a starting point for further improvements. Overall, this project showcases the power of data science in extracting valuable insights from data, and the ability to analyze and visualize the data in a meaningful way."
